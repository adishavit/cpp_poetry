Saving the art of the C++ Slack #poerty channel for posterity  
    
  
#poetry  
  
Phil Nash:  
there was a new channel called #poetry  
whose content was decidely throwaway  
but starting with root  
and more nodes to boot  
we realised that we could just grow a tree  
  
Adi Shavit:  
I say it shall be,  
a repository  
of poetry inspiration.   
  
Where the poor coder,  
or poet or speaker,  
may find slides for their presentation.  
  
Phil Nash:  
```  
auto theAnswer( int b ) {  
    auto question = [=]{ return (2*b) | !(2*b); };  
    return question();  
}  
int main() {  
    return theAnswer(21);  
}  
```  
  
Kab:  
Here is my ACK  
This poem is whack

Remember when selecting a container, vector is best;  
Leave a comment when choosing one of the rest.  
  
I need some help with this one:  
(With apologies to @patricer and other Cohen lovers, like me)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device  
  
Leonard Cohen on Duff's device:  
  
Now I've heard there was a secret code  
That Duff did type, and it pleased the load/Lord  
But you don't really care for coding, do you?  
It goes like this  
The for, the switch  
The minor fallthrough, the performance lift  
The baffled dev composing Unrolled loops, yeah   
Unrolled loops, yeah  
Unrolled loops, yeah  
Unrolled loops, yeah  
Unrolled loops, yeah  
  
So, "load" or "Lord"? - load makes sense for performance, but I like connecting Duff's device to something holy/mystical  
  
Simon Brand:  
  
My compiler has betrayed me and left me to my fate,  
My program doesn't work, it just calls `std::terminate`.  
  
Kab  
I find that when you're a newbie  
Your biggest headache is UB  
  
Tveerd  
Causing me pain with his fingers  
Filling my app with his code‎  
Killing me softly with his code  
Killing me softly with his code  
Filling my whole life with his code  
Killing me softly with his code  
  
I heard he wrote some good code, I heard he had a style  
And so I came to see him, to listen for a while  
And there he was, this bad dev, a bungler to my eyes‎  
  
Causing me pain with his fingers  
Filling my app with his code‎  
Killing me softly with his code  
Killing me softly with his code  
Filling my whole life with his code  
Killing me softly with his code  
  
I felt all flushed with anger, embarrassed by the code  
I felt he'd found my patterns and turned each one around  
I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on  
  
Causing me pain with his fingers  
Filling my app with his code‎  
Killing me softly with his code  
Killing me softly with his code  
Filling my whole life with his code  
Killing me softly with his code  
  
Adi  
There goes my time with this channel,  
Deadlines rush by with a whoosh,  
Killing my produc-tivity  
Killing it softly with his poems  
Killing it softly with his poems  
Filling my inbox, @tvaneerd songs  
Killing it softly, with his poems.

If you change your mind, on the node first in line  
Honey I was free  
Take a chance on me  
Gonna do my very best, but I may be a lie  
If you put me to the [cas] test, if you let me try  
Take a chance on me  
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me

'Twas the night be release  
Yet VC's were about to divest  
Not a file was compiling  
Not even a test  
  
(need to start practicing for Christmas)  
  
Nicole Mazzuca  
I like monads and I cannot lie  
you other coders can't deny  
when IO walks in with an itty-bitty bind  
and side effects on the mind  
I get sprung  
  
Stephan Boekelman  
a programmer applies - you ask him what for  
he says the whole stack - blue sky to green floor  
  
you question his answer - in order to agree  
tell me the difference - npn to pnp  
  
he shrugs his shoulders - physics' not his best  
you begin to wonder - but grant a second test  
  
tell me how many - from NAND to NOR  
as much as the other way - it merely takes four!  
  
you go for high five - with a flick of the wrist  
the applicant lags - about to resist  
  
150k - no more nor less  
you take down your arm - in an unconscious process   
  
says as a JS guy - he's clearly worth more  
you facepalm your self - and show him the door  
  
Adi  
I’m proud, I must tell you,  
You’ll have to agree,  
That programming’s a bit like   
Good poetry.   
  
The structure is rigid,  
The syntax is too,  
Semantics emergent and   
Not easy to do.   
  
But devs have a critic  
That poets do not,  
The one that enforces  
compiling or not.  
  
Jens Weller  
The archives are depleted,  
all poetry has been deleted.  
  
Kab  
Since these lines are ephemeral,  
better make backups several  
  
Tveerd  
Now that's a travesty;  
Almost as bad as coding in C.  
  
Jon Kalb  
With the speed of horse-drawn coaches  
the submission deadline approaches.  
You’ll have so much fun in Aspen  
When you send your proposed talk in.  
  
Jena Weller  
Thinking about to commit to C++Now,  
what talk to submit to enjoy a few days of snow?  
With out much fuzz, it should be something about C++,  
but it also should be cutting edge, otherwise I'll not get the program committees match...  
So I ponder, and wonder should I wait with submitting how much longer?

Constexpr if constexpr if  
I have lived just for this  
I can explain why I do not  
Miss SFINAE  
  
enable_if enable_if  
Held me captive - just a bit  
But I can explain why I do not  
Miss SFINAE  
  
Every time I'd specialize  
Clouds of errors  
Burst from the compiler  
  
Don't ask why, don't ask why  
I'll reply with just a sigh  
But I can explain why I do not  
Miss SFINAE  
Miss SFINAE...  
  
Jens Weller:  
Your modifications fix the calculation  
But I’m afraid you forgot a tabulation.  
This is the beginning of your tribulation.  
Your perfect correction won’t bring you elation.  
  
If there was a way to just automate,  
Maybe you could avoid arguing with your mate.  
Should there be a space after the bracket  
How many white spaces, How many line breaks  
  
Did you know tools could format your troubles away?  
You have to choose, there is no midway  
Tool-able or arguably palatable?  
Tastefulness is debatable, not checkable!  
  
You may be expressionist or constructivist.  
Alas the whole situation is surrealist.  
Kernighanists are not great artists  
Neither are Whitesmiths and Allmanists, that’s the gist.  
  
I too like Guillaume Apollinaire.  
Hand crafted alignment falls in disrepair.  
Are you trying to win the IOCCC ?  
Your sole concern should be consistency.  
  
There is no value in what is invisible.  
No semantic in what is not expressible.  
A line break or not, what’s the différance  
For Git, noisy inconvenient difference  
  
Is indentation really communicative?  
Of what can emptiness be indicative?  
There is no point, your patch is not applicable  
Not comparable, not even shareable.  
  
For the love or your project’s contributors  
Don’t act like an art gallery curator.  
Clear rules should control the look of each line  
Put them in an enforceable guideline  
  
It took a while, now we have modern tools.  
The have limitations and act like fools.  
For they have one goal, uniformity.  
Pick a style then use it consistently.  
  
Your code won’t be magnificent and perfect.  
But it will be readable, it’s what I expect.  
Tool-able, Merge-able, Refactor-able  
Qualities that I find truly adorable.  
  
Pick a style then use it consistently.  
Then concentrate on things that matter really.  
And so use a tool and accept its caveats  
For your productivity, use clang-format.

On the twelfth day of Christmas  
the committee sent to me:  
Twelve file systems  
Eleven uncaught exceptions  
Ten removed trigraphs  
Nine maybe unuseds  
Eight fold expressions  
Seven stood optionals  
Six stood variants  
Five constexpr ifs  
Four stood conjunctions  
Three stood negations  
Two stood disjunctions  
and parallel algorithms.

I have archived  
the poems  
that were in  
the channel  
  
and which  
you were probably  
saving  
to read sometimes  
  
Forgive me  
they were funny  
so C++  
and so rhyming  
  
Ben Steffan  
"Is this channel still  
alive?", I ask, lamenting  
the bare void within.  
  
Adi Shavit  
Indeed it is, despite Slack’s haste  
I saved it all with copy-paste.   
Still need to start a repository  
For all the witty poetry

For your, wise words.

There once was a man from Kitchener  
Who was a poet as well as a presenter.  
He wrote a haiku about Apsen  
so sweet it made my head spin,  
So I shared it with my followers on twitter.  
  
**Kevin**  
Off-by-one on the third  
But I wouldn't have done better, as a bird  
  
**Dave Belcher**  
There was a programmer called Gus  
Who wanted to stream to the bus  
He didn't have fun  
Cus he was off by one  
Until he added plus plus  
  
**Nicholas Timmons**  
A standard was made called C++17,  
but the lines they were not read in-between,  
Its such a depressor  
Now that the 'if constexpr'esor  
*Make weakly typed C++ definitions routine*

In the constructor  
Object is not fully formed  
Be careful with `this`

Of C++, I can’t get my fill.  
After two dozen years, it’s still a thrill,  
But my wife took a vacation stand  
Planned a trip, long ago, to Switzerland.  
We’ll see it all, we really will,  
Every town, except Rapperswill.
